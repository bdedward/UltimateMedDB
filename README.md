.NET Hospital Management System Application

Welcome to the development of my Windows Stack Application (.NET Framework with ASP.NET)

The intention for this project is to build a Hosptial Management System.

The User Stories which drive the development of this Project are:

1.  As a Billing specialist I want to be able to Bill a Patient, and to check outstanding bills.

2.  As a Hosptial coordinator I want to assign an available Room to a Patient.  I also want to be able to modify 
the status of a Room.

3.  As a Medical Assistant I need to be able to add new Patients and modify Patient information.  Also to check
on the status of any Labs ordered by the Doctor.

4.  As a lab technician add a new Lab into the system for the Patient.

5.  As a Doctor, NP, or Nurse I need to be able to look up Lab information for the Patient.
